First, you will try encryption with the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is 
very simple: every letter of the plaintext message is replaced by the 
letter *n* places on in the alphabet. The number *n* is the key to the cipher. 
For example, if *n = 3*, every *a* is replaced by *d*, every *y* is replaced 
by *b*, and so on. For *n = 3*, here is a table of substitutions:

| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| d | e | f | g | h | i | j | k | l | m | n | o | p | q | r | s | t | u | v | w | x | y | z | a | b | c |
